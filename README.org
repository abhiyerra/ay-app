#+TITLE: ay-app

ay-app is the Emacs script that powers [[http://abhiyerra.com][abhiyerra.com]]. It uses the
Emacs plugin [[https://github.com/nicferrier/elnode][elnode]] and largely served with org-mode.

This repo includes a docker script to setup an environment to install
org-mode and elnode with the current emacs environment. It will then
allow you to setup the correct ssh-key and checkout a repo which has
the website.
